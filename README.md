# are-you-still-here

## About

"Are you still here?" is is a project by Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga, started in September 2020.

This project is a digital instrument to check if institutions still exist, and alert when they don't anymore.

The instrument periodically pings Wikipedia, and checks if the article is written in present or past tense. When it changes to past tense, the institution is no more, and the instrument emits beeping, text, or motion.

In this repository you can find documentation on how it works and instructions to build your own version.

## The artwork

This is a collection of three different sculptures.

## Hardware

This project is built on a Arduino Nano 33 IOT.

## Software

The code included is for flashing the Arduino.

create a file called internetLogin.h via the Arduino IDE.

Add this code

```h
#define NETWORK_NAME     "yourNetworkName"
#define NETWORK_PASS     "yourNetworkPass"
```
